 - Pollo contains many third-party libraries:
    - Apache's Xerces for XML Parsing and it's DOM implementation. (the
      support of Xerces for mutation events is essential to Pollo).
    - Log4j for logging (not used much yet).
    - Apache Jakarta's Commons Digester for building the configuration
      objects from XML files.
    - Sun's excellent Multi Schema Validator (MSV) for support of
      XML Schema, RELAX-NG, DTD, etc.
    - Jaxen to evaluate XPath expressions.
    - Javahelp for online help.

   See the online help for the licenses of these libraries.

 - Thanks to Al Byers for getting me started on MSV support.
