Pollo is a program to edit XML files. It's best suited for
files which can be represented solely using a tree structure.
Fortunately this applies to many XML files.

It is currently still in development. It is neither considered
complete or stable.

Do not hesitate to send bug reports, comments, suggestions, patches,
