Pollo is a program to edit XML files. It's best
suited for files which can be represented solely using
a tree structure. Fortunately this applies to many XML files.

It is currently still in development. It is neither considered
complete or stable.

Do not hesitate to send bug reports, comments, suggestions, patches,
contributions, etc to the author.

Some usage hints:
 - many functionality is hidden in the right mouse
   button context menu.
 - nodes can be dragged and dropped.
 - These are the keyboard bindings:
    - arrow up or k: select previous node
    - arrow down or j: select next node
    - ctrl+c: copy selected node
    - ctrl+x: cut selected node
    - ctrl+v: paste after selected node
    - ctrl+z: undo
    - <delete> deletes the selected node
    - o: moves focus to the 'insert after' list
    - O (capital o): moves focus to the 'insert before' list
    - i: moves focus to the 'insert inside' list
    - when in the insert after/before/inside list: press
      enter to insert an item, after pressing enter the focus
      moves to the main view again
    - when on an element or text/comment node, press enter to
      move the attribute/text editor
    - minus and plus: collapse and expand
    - ctrl-minus and ctrl-plus: collapse all and expand all

Other notes:
 - In XPath expressions, you can use all the namespace prefixes
   defined on the document element (= root element).
 - The node list returned by the XPath engine is not always in
   document order.
 - tabs in text or comment nodes are shown as boxes. This will
   be fixed in the next release.
