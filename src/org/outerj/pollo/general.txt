Pollo is a program to edit XML files. Currently it's best
suited for files which can be represented solely using
a tree structure. But this applies to many XML files.

Some usage hints:
 - many functionality is hidden in the right mouse
   button context menu.
 - nodes can be dragged and dropped.

At some time in the future I'll add some information
here about how to add support for new filetypes.

Many features are still missing, most notable keyboard
support.

This project is hosted at sourceforge:
