version 0.2
===========
 - rendering/editing of comment nodes, text nodes, cdata nodes
 - comment out / uncomment
 - text clipping (append '...' if text doesn't fit on the screen)
 - opening multiple files, multiple views on same file
 - replacement of elementdragpanel with nodeinsertionpanel
 - on parsing, all textnodes that only contain whitespace are removed.
   (this is not conformant with the xml spec since only when a schema is
   present, the application can really know what whitespace is ignorable).
   On saving, the XML is indented again (todo: make this user-configurable).
 - save as
 - dropping on element onto itself or as a descendant of itself not allowed anymore
 - initial support for ant files (added an antschema.xml and antspec.xml,
   both files are automatically generated).
 - better indication of the selected node (using thick black border)
 - use mousePressed instead of mouseClicked event to select nodes (otherwise
   some clicks seemed to get lost)
 - a drag-and-drop can now be undone in one step (previously this required
   chosing undo twice). This is done by adding the concept of
   undo-transactions to the undo engine. Update: did the same for 'uncomment'
   and 'comment out' actions.
 - changes to attributes are applied directly to the DOM (no need to press
   the 'Apply changes' button anymore). There's now a clear visible
   distinction between an attribute with no value and one with has empty
   string as value. Attributes are alfabetically sorted.
 - collapse all/expand all
 - eliminated the use of the 'java.text.TextLayout' class, which has resulted
   in large speed improvements.
 - added about dialog with license information.
 - autoscroll when dragging
 - xpath expressions in the schema now resolve namespace prefixes to
   namespaces defined in the schema, rather than in the instance document.
 - and much more...

version 0.1
