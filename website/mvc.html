<h1>Pollo: MVC</h1>
 
<p>Pollo's internal design is based on a pattern called 'MVC' (Model-View-Controller). 
From a user perspective, this allows you to open multiple views on the same 
file.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>Pollo follows the trend seen in modern webbrowsers such as <a
 href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> by allowing views to be created either 
in new windows, or as new tab within the same window.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>By default, when opening a file, it is added as a new tab to the current 
window.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>To open a file in a new window, first create a new window by choosing View
| New Frame in the menubar, and then open the file by choosing File | Open
from the menubar in the newly created window.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>To create a new view on an already opened file, choose View | Create new 
view on file | (file name).<br>
