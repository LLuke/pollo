<h1>Pollo: miscellaneous notes<br>
</h1>
<h2>Whitespace handling, reformat when saving</h2>
<p>When Pollo opens a file, it will strip all text nodes that consist of
only whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). Otherwise a lot of white boxes
would be displayed in the tree for these nodes.<br>
</p>
<p>When saving a file, Pollo will do some pretty-serializing of the file.
The way this is done will become configurable in a future release.<br>
</p>
<h2>User preferences file (.pollorc)</h2>
<p>When Pollo exits, it saves a file called ".pollorc" in your home directory.
This file contains stuff like recently opened files and the location and
size of Pollo's window.</p>
<h2>Opening non-well-formed XML files</h2>
<p>When you open a file in Pollo that cannot be parsed, Pollo will display
it in <a href="textview.html">text view</a>. In that case, the file will
be opened with Java's default encoding (which depends on the platform).<br>
</p>
<h2>Changing the encoding of a file</h2>
<p>To change the encoding of a file, switch to text mode and change it there
in the XML declaration.<br>
</p>
<h2>Reusing Pollo's tree widget</h2>
<p>I'll write about this later. If you are interested in this, please let
me know.<br>
