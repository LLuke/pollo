<h1>Pollo: display specifications</h1>
<p>A "display specification" is the thing that defines what colors are used 
in Pollo's tree view. Additionally, it can specify the ordening of the attributes. 
This is because in the data model used by Pollo (the DOM), the attributes 
have no order. However, it is usually convenient to see attributes in some
specific order.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>There are multiple display specification implementations available:<br>
 </p>
 
<ul>
  <li>One that reads its behaviour from a file</li>
  <li>One that uses a fixed color</li>
  <li>One that randomly assigns colors to elements<br>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, it is possible to write your own.<br>
