<h1>Pollo: design notes</h1>
<p>This document contains some rough notes on Pollo's internal design.<br>
</p>
<p>If you are only interested in extending Pollo with some special features
for editing a certain kind of XML file, then you can probably achieve that
by writing plugins, a schema and a display specification. Take a look at
the <a href="cocoon.html">Cocoon view type</a> for an example of this.<br>
</p>
<p>This document assumes that you are to some extent familiar with Java,
Swing, XML and the Java API's for XML. It will also help if you are familiar
with design patterns (such as MVC). And of course you should be familiar
with Pollo.<br>
 </p>
 
<h2>Pollo, PolloFrame and EditorPanel<br>
</h2>
<p>The execution of Pollo starts in the main method of the class Pollo. This
class will:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>check command line parameters</li>
  <li>initialise the configuration (this is acutally handled by the PolloConfiguration
and PolloConfigurationFactory objects)</li>
  <li>display an initial "PolloFrame"<br>
  </li>
</ul>
A PolloFrame is a JFrame which manages a number of EditorPanel's. An EditorPanel
is a JPanel providing an 'editor' for a certain file. The PolloFrame will
display these EditorPanel's in different tabs, so that the user can switch
between them.<br>
<p>An EditorPanel itself is associated with one XmlModel (described further
on) and provides (actually: can provide, I only describe here the behaviour
of the default implementation called EditorPanelImpl) two possible views
on it: a textview and a treeview. The EditorPanel also manages the toolbar
and the menubar. As the user switches between EditorPanel's with the tabs,
the PolloFrame will switch the menubar and toolbar of the frame to that of
the current EditorPanel.<br>
</p>
<p>Multiple EditorPanel's can be associated with one XmlModel (= one file).
When the last EditorPanel associated with a particular XmlModel is closed,
the XmlModel itself will be closed, asking if the file represented by the
XmlModel needs to be saved if it was modified.<br>
</p>
<h2>XmlModel</h2>
<p>A document is at any time in one of two states:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>text mode = the document is represented by a subclass of Swing's PlainDocument
(basically a character array)</li>
  <li>parsed mode = the document is represented by a DOM tree</li>
</ul>
This two representations are managed by an enclosing class, XmlModel. XmlModel
also manages loading and saving of the file. When a file is initially loaded,
it will by default always be in parsed mode, except if it could not be parsed,
in which case it will fall back to text mode.
<h2></h2>
<h2>The Tree View (XmlEditor)</h2>
<p>Pollo's tree view is a component implemented from scratch, it extends
JComponent. The class is called XmlEditor.<br>
</p>
<p>XmlEditor needs the following:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>an XmlModel, containing the data to be shown</li>
  <li>an implementation of IDisplaySpecification: this interface can be queried
about display attributes such as element colors and attribute orderning</li>
  <li>optionally: an XPath expression pointing to the root node to be displayed
in the view<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The basic design is as follows. Uppon initial display (when the component
gets its first paint event), a so-called <em>view tree</em> is build. This
is a tree of view objects, these are objects that contain layout information
and can paint themselves on a java.awt.Graphics object. Each of this view
objects corresponds to a node in the DOM tree. For different types of DOM
nodes, different types of view objects are instantiated.<br>
</p>
<p>After building this tree, the layout() method of the root view object
is called with as parameter the available width. The root view object will
then call the layout method of all its children, passing the width they can
occupy as parameter. These view objects will then call the layout method
recursively on their children, and so on. After the layout method returns,
the caller (which is the parent view object), can call getHeight on its child(ren)
to know how much space they occupy, and can thereby finish calculating its
own layout, so that control returns to the layout method of its parent, and
so, until we're back at the root node and the layout process has finished.<br>
</p>
<p>Now the paint method can be called on the root view object, passing the
top and left coordinates. The root View object will then paint itself and
will then recursively cause the paint methods of all the children to be called,
until the whole tree is painted. Actually, not the whole tree is painted
on each paint event, but only those View objects which intersect with clipping
area.<br>
</p>
<p>During the instantiation of the view objects, each view object also registers
itself with its corresonding DOM-node to listen for Mutation Events. Mutation
Events are a part of the <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Events-20001113/events.html">DOM
specification</a>.When a view object receives a Mutation Event from its corresponding
DOM node, it will relayout and repaint itself. If nodes were inserted or
removed, the parent view objects will also be (recursively) warned to grow
or shrink their height.<br>
</p>
<p>When mouse-click events occur on the XmlEditor component, these are propagated
through the view tree until they reach the view object containing the x/y
location of the click event. This vew object will then fire NodeClicked-events
to all registered listeners. For example, the status bar showing the currently
selected node is such a listener, but there are many others. These listeners
are actually registered on the XmlEditor, not on each individual view object.<br>
</p>
<h2>Undo (parsed mode)</h2>
<p>The Undo is simply implemented by an object registered as MutationEvent-listener
on the root node of the DOM-tree, which will catch all events happening in
the tree, and record them so they can be undone later.<br>
</p>
<p>Sometimes multiple MutationEvents form one logical user action, therefore
the concept of "UndoTransactions" was introduced. See the source code ;-)<br>
</p>
<h2>XmlEditorPanel</h2>
<p>XmlEditorPanel is a panel that combines the XmlEditor tree widget with
some other panels to provide full editor functionality:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the NodeDetailsPanel shows either the attribute editor (if the selected
node is an element node) or the "character data editor" for textnodes, comment
nodes, ...</li>
  <li>the NodeInsertionPanel contains the listboxes to select elements from</li>
  <li>the QueryByXPathPanel contains the XPath functionality</li>
  <li>the NodePathBar shows the path to the selected node</li>
</ul>
Apart from the XmlModel and the DisplaySpecification that the XmlEditor requires,
the XmlEditorPanel also needs a reference to an object implementing ISchema.
This interface can be queried about available elements and attributes, and
can be asked to validate the document.<br>
<h2>About IDisplaySpecification and ISchema</h2>
<p>Both the schema and display specification implementations are abstracted
by an interface, so that multiple implementations can be provided. The actual
implementations to use are part of the so called ViewType. ViewTypes can
be configured in Pollo's configuration file, pollo_conf.xml.<br>
</p>
<p>Both the schema and display specifications can be chained. By this I mean
that you can put multiple implementations of them after each other. For example,
for the display specification, first the first display specification is asked
for the color to use for an element, if that one returns null, the next one
will be asked for the color, etc. until there is a display specification
that has the answer. For schemas there is something similar, but instead
it merges the answers from the different schemas.<br>
</p>
<h2>View Types</h2>
<p>A ViewType is the combination of:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a series of displayspecifications</li>
  <li>a series of schemas</li>
  <li>a series of attribute editor plugins</li>
  <li>a series of action plugins<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Action plugins are optional, for the rest default implementations will
be used if none is specified.<br>
</p>
<h2>The text editor</h2>
<p>The text-editor is based on the free jedit syntax package (which is an
older version of the GPL <a href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a> editor).
The text view doesn't contain much feature besides well-formedness checking.
Volunteers to tackle this are welcome.<br>
</p>
<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>In case you would be confused about this: the schema and model packages
which are currently a subpackage of the package xmleditor, should be moved
one level up because they are not specific for the xmleditor, but are used
or could be used by the texteditor also.<br>
</p>
<h2>Inversion of Control violations</h2>
<p>At some places the Pollo-class singleton instance is accessed by using
a static getInstance method. This violates the so-called "inversion of control"
principle, and makes reusing some parts of Pollo difficult. More specific,
XmlEditorPanel uses this to get access to get configuration information and
can therefore not be reused in other Swing applications withouth some hacking.
This will be fixed in a future Pollo release. The XmlEditor class itself
should be reusable though.<br>
