<h1>Pollo: supported schema languages</h1>
             
<p>Pollo supports schema languages to help you edit your documents.</p>
             
<p>For those who don't know what a schema language is: a schema languages 
   defines the allowed structure of an XML document. It does this by specifying 
the   set of valid element names, their attributes, and the content allowed 
in  the elements. A document can then be validated against the schema, to 
check  if the document conforms to the structure described in the schema.<br>
       </p>
             
<h2>History<br>
       </h2>
             
<p>Pollo needed a schema language that supports namespaces. Yet that schema
   language should be very simple, so that it could &nbsp;be implemented
in   a matter of hours. Or there should be a library available to quickly
embed   support for that schema language in Pollo. XML DTD's, although relatively
  simple, don't support namespaces. So I decided to invent my own little
schema   language.</p>
       Since then, support for mainstream schema languages has been added 
(XML   Schema, DTD, Relax NG, some others), although maybe in a controversial
 manner   (see further on).<br>
       <br>
             
<h2>Pollo's schema language</h2>
       With Pollo's schema language the following properties can be defined 
for an element (optionally when occuring nested in another element): 
<ul>
          <li>a list of child elements (this is just an enumeration, not
a  real   content model).<br>
          </li>
                     
</ul>
 
<ul>
          <li>the attributes that can appear on the element</li>
                     
</ul>
 
<ul>
          <li>for those attributes, an enumeration of possible attribute
values    can be defined, either as a fixed list, or dynamically composed
&nbsp;by   evaluating an XPath expression on the document you're editing</li>
                     
</ul>
             
<p>The above features are thought out to be usefull for editing documents,
   and not for validating a document against it.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>Here's a small extract from the Cocoon Sitemap schema as an example:<br>
 </p>
 
<pre>&lt;schema xmlns:map="http://apache.org/cocoon/sitemap/1.0"&gt;<br>    &lt;element name="map:generate"&gt;<br>        &lt;attributes&gt;<br>            &lt;attribute name="type" readvaluesfrom="/map:sitemap/map:components/map:generators/map:generator/@name"/&gt;<br>            &lt;attribute name="src"/&gt;<br>            &lt;attribute name="label"/&gt;<br>        &lt;/attributes&gt;<br>        &lt;allowedsubelements names="map:parameter"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/element&gt;<br>    &lt;element name="map:action-set/map:act"&gt;<br>        &lt;attributes&gt;<br>            &lt;attribute name="type" readvaluesfrom="/map:sitemap/map:components/map:actions/map:action/@name"/&gt;<br>            &lt;attribute name="src"/&gt;<br>            &lt;attribute name="action"/&gt;<br>        &lt;/attributes&gt;<br>        &lt;allowedsubelements names=""/&gt;<br>    &lt;/element&gt;<br>    [...]<br>&lt;/schema&gt;<br></pre>
 
<p>Notice that the second element definition only applies to map:act elements 
occuring as child of map:action-set</p>
 
<p>The syntax of Pollo's schema language may be a bit ugly, but that's because
   it was created (and implemented) in just a couple of hours. If someone 
wants   to improve it, feel free.<br>
   </p>
     
<p>It is not possible to validate a document against a Pollo schema, Pollo 
 schemas can only be used to guide editing.<br>
      </p>

<h2>Other schema languages (XML Schema, Relax NG, DTD, ...)</h2>
             
<p>Pollo supports a range of schema languages through the <a
 href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/xml/developers/multischema/">"Multi Schema
   Validator" library from Sun</a>. More precisely the following languages 
should work: XML Schema, DTD, Relax NG, Relax Core, Relax ns and Trex.<br>
       </p>
             
<p>These schema languages can be used in Pollo both to guide you while editing 
 (i.e. to show the available elements and attributes), and to validate your 
 document against it.<br>
   </p>
     
<p>One important thing about schema languages like XML Schema and Relax NG 
 is that they allow you to reuse the same element name in different places 
 On each place the element name is used, it is possible to specify different 
 attributes and a different content model. While this is a powerfull feature, 
 it makes things a lot harder for XML editors. After all, the editor cannot 
 determine from the element name alone what attributes it can have, but it 
 should look in what context the element occurs. But while you're editing 
a document, the document may be in an invalid state making it impossible to
determine the right type of the element. Pollo works around this by looking 
 only at the element name, and by showing all elements that can be inserted 
 and showing all attributes that can occur on the element with that name, 
regardless of the context in which the element is used.<br>
   </p>
     
<p>If you want to see precisely what can occur inside the element, or what 
 attributes it can have, select that element, and then choose 'Schema | Show 
 Content Model' in the menubar. This will validate the document up to the 
selected element, and then asks the validator what content it expects there, 
which is then displayed. (This is an experimental feature).<br>
   </p>
     
<p>To validate your document against the schema, choose 'Schema | Validate 
 document' in the menubar. If the document is valid, a message box will be 
displayed to let you know it is. If any validation errors occured, a panel 
will be displayed to  show them. By double clicking on an item in the validation 
error list, you  will jump to the location in the document where that error 
was detected.  <br>

<h2>About DTD's</h2>
<p>Pollo will not automatically use the DTD declared using DOCTYPE in your
document.</p>
<p>Pollo does however support using DTD's through MSV, just select them in
the 'View Type' dialog you get after opening a file. There's one important
limitation though: you cannot use DTD's if you use namespaces.<br>
</p>
<h2>Further possibilities</h2>
     
<h3>Alternative implementations</h3>
   Pollo allows new schema implementations to be plugged in, without changing 
 anything in Pollo itself. &nbsp;This could be used to bring support for new
 schema languages (or alternative implementations) to Pollo, or to write the
 validation logic directly in Java (for things that can't be expressed in
schemas).<br>
     
<h3>Chaining schemas</h3>
   Another feature of Pollo is to chain multiple schemas together. This could 
 be used when constructing documents that contain elements from different 
schemas. For example, to combine a WSDL schema with an XML Schema schema. 
This functionality is available but currently not demonstrated in the default
configuration that comes with Pollo, and neither really tested.<br>
