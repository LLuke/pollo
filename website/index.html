		<h1>Pollo, the XML editor</h1>

		<h2>What is it?</h2>
		<p>
		Pollo lets you edit XML files. It's best
		suited for files which can be represented in a tree
		structure. It comes with built-in support
		for <a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon2/index.html">Cocoon</a> sitemap files,
		<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a> build files and XML Schemas.
		</p>
		<p>
		The editor has a colourfull tree widget (not the default Swing one!),
		drag-and-drop support, unlimmited undo, model-view design (open
		multiple views on the same file), ...

		<h2>Feature list</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Cross-platform: Pollo is based on Java 1.3, which is available
			for most Windows variants, Linux, and other operating systems.
			</li>
			<li>In contrast to many other Java-based tree XML editors, it uses
			its own <b>custom-implemented widget</b> to display XML files.</li>
			<li>Supports <b>drag-and-drop</b> of nodes.</li>
			<li>Is internally completely based on an <b>MVC-design</b>, the model
			is a standard-compliant DOM tree (Apache's Xerces implementation)
			that is connected to the view using standard DOM mutation events.
			As a consequence, if the DOM is changed by any code, the corresponding
			view(s) update automatically.</li>
			<li><font color="red">NEW</font> Editing of <b>any well-formed XML file</b>:
			Pollo can open any well-formed XML file and display it, without
			needing a schema or style sheet.</li>
			<li><font color="red">NEW</font> Use XPath expressions to find nodes. Pollo
			can execute any XPath expression, making it usefull as an XPath experimenting
			and learning tool.</li>
			<li>Pollo can be <b>customised</b> for a particular XML file type by
			using schemas, display specifications (also known as 'style sheets'),
			and plugins. Pollo comes with examples for Cocoon Sitemaps, Ant buildfiles
			and W3C XML Schemas. For the (or a) next release, documentation will
			be provided on how you can add your own.</li>
			<li><b>Schemas</b>: the editing of a certain type of XML file is guided
			by a schema. A schema knows about which attributes and which
			subelements an element can have. It can also define picklists
			for attributes. <font color="red">NEW</font> A powerfull feature of
			schema's in Pollo is that they can be chained: this way, multiple
			schema's can be combined as they were one big schema. This is for example
			usefull for combining a WSDL schema with an XML Schemas schema. The schema
			implementation classes and factories are defined in a configuration
			file, which allows for
			easy future extension.</li>
			<li><b>Display specifications</b> ('style sheets'): these tell Pollo what colors to use,
			and in what order the attributes must be shown on the element.
			Just like schemas, display specifications can be chained. The
			implementation classes and factories are also defined in a
			configuration file.</li>
			<li><font color="red">NEW</font> Attribute editor <b>plugins</b>: it is possible
			to define plugins that provide the component to be used for editing
			an attribute value. As an example, Pollo includes a plugin for Ant
			that adds a button for quick access to properties. Note: in the future,
			other types of plugins will also be provided.</li>
			<li><font color="red">NEW</font> <b>Templates</b>: new files can be made based on templates. In Pollo,
			a template is defined by a Java class, meaning that any Java code
			that can generate a DOM-tree can be used to generate templates on
			the fly (eg by a wizard that asks questions, or by reading something
			from a database, ...). Currently, Pollo comes with an implementation
			that parses a template file. Documentation on how to make your own
			is planned for the near future.</li>
			<li>It is licensed under the terms of the MIT license, which
			means it is completely <b>free for personal and comerical use</b>.</li>

		<h2>What's the status?</h2>
		<p>
		Usable but not finished.
		</p>

		<h2>Platforms?</h2>
		<p>
		Pollo is written for Java 1.3. I mostly developed it on
		Linux but have done some testing on Windows also. Make
		sure you have a recent JDK version (but not 1.4).
		</p>

		<h2>How do I get it?</h2>
		<p>
		Download the zip at the sourceforge <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/pollo">project site</a>.
		Unzip the file (if you don't have a zip tool you can do this with java's jar command: <tt>java xvf pollo-0.3-bin.zip</tt>)<br/>
		Pollo can then be started by executing the following command: <tt>java -jar pollo.jar</tt><br/>
		See the included README for more details.
