How to run Pollo:

- Make sure you have a recent JDK (or JRE) from the 1.3 series installed.
  You can download one from http://java.sun.com/getjava/

  If you use Linux, I recommend the most recent Sun JDK, 1.3.1_01, since
  I exprerienced some small problems with earlier versions. In the IBM JDK
  for Linux, double clicking didn't seem to work.

  Java 1.4 is not yet supported.

- Then type the following command:
    java -jar pollo.jar

  Alternatively, if you are using Windows, you may also be able to double
  click on pollo.jar to start Pollo.
